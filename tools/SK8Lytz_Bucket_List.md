### Target: `main`
**Epic: Bucketlist Phase/Batch Roadmap Declaration (branch `chore/bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration`)**
*(Archived — 2026-07-23)*
*Logged by `/idea_intake` following a `/whiteboard_mode` session — 2026-07-23. Executed as a single-task `/bucketlist` pass (commit `994e134`).*

#### 🟡 P2 — Enhancements & Automation
- [x] `chore/bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration` : **Bucketlist Phase/Batch Roadmap Declaration** - Amend [.claude/commands/bucketlist.md](../.claude/commands/bucketlist.md)'s Pre-Task Intelligence Swarm (step 3) so that when the implementation-planner discovers a phase's true scope is far bigger than one batch can resolve, it must state a forward-looking roadmap (rough batch/phase grouping, not a precise count) at the HALT-for-approval gate — before executing anything — instead of only narrating "Batch N/N" reactively after each pass. Derived from a `/whiteboard_mode` session ([docs/architecture/bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration.md](../docs/architecture/bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration.md)) that found `/idea_intake` itself needs no changes: the one true multi-phase epic in this ledger (Nomenclature Audit Engine) was already correctly sized by `/whiteboard_mode` *before* `/idea_intake` ever logged it (7 minutes apart per git history) — the "phases upon phases" feeling came from inside an already-correctly-flagged-as-large phase's batch execution (`debt/nomenclature-remediation`'s 11 batches), not from intake mis-sizing. Two alternative front-door fixes to `/idea_intake` (grep-based footprint triage, linguistic self-check gate) were evaluated and rejected — neither has a validated historical failure case, and both would false-positive heavily against genuinely bounded tasks already in this ledger (`epic/red-team-audit`, `epic/legacy-code-janitor`, `debt/documentation-consolidation`, `debt/eslint-warnings-sweep`, etc.) that use the same "audit/sweep/across" language without ever becoming multi-phase. *Done — inserted the "Scope-explosion escape valve" bullet immediately after the "synthesize outputs into a combined batch plan" line (not wedged between Agent B_i and Agent C, a placement error caught and corrected by the implementation-planner during independent verification) and amended the HALT prompt to explicitly call out a Roadmap when present. This task's own execution served as its first regression test: a normal, bounded, single-file batch did not trigger a Roadmap section, confirming the new rule doesn't over-fire on ordinary tasks. A true end-to-end test of the escape valve actually triggering can only happen the next time a real task's scope balloons mid-swarm — flagged as a "confirm on next natural occurrence" follow-up, not a blocker. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=15/after=15, both pre-existing advisory-only findings in unrelated `tools/*.html` files), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/chore-bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration.md](../docs/plans/chore-bucketlist-phase-roadmap-declaration.md)) [Files: .claude/commands/bucketlist.md]

### Target: `main`
**Epic: Master Reference Doc Sync (branch `debt/master-reference-doc-sync`)**
*(Archived — 2026-07-23)*
*Logged as a Technical Debt item during `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 9 — 2026-07-19. Executed as a single-task `/bucketlist` pass on `debt/master-reference-doc-sync` (commit `708a2b0`).*

#### 🟢 Low — Documentation
- [🚀] `debt/master-reference-doc-sync` : **[tools/SK8Lytz_App_Master_Reference.md:561, 591](../tools/SK8Lytz_App_Master_Reference.md)** — stale documentation discovered during `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 9: both lines described `cycleCountManagerModal` and its required `#barcode-reader` element as the live STOCKZ scanner UI, but neither DOM id exists anymore (superseded by `stockzAuditModal`/`stockzAuditLocalReader` in a past redesign). *Done — fixed all 4 Master Reference line references (316, 444 — confirmed verbatim-duplicated "WebRTC Scanner Layouts" section, both copies fixed independently — plus 561, 591) to cite the live `stockzAuditModal`/`stockzAuditLocalReader` ids while preserving the iOS Safari `aspect-ratio`/`{aspectRatio: 1.0}` hardware-constraint knowledge (confirmed still accurate/live at inventory-module.js:2369/2397) and noting the still-live `openCycleCountManager`/`closeCycleCountManager` compatibility aliases (inventory-module.js:2148-2154) so a future reader isn't confused. User-approved scope addition: also fixed the identical stale claim at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:404`. `tools/remote-scanner.html`'s own genuinely separate, real `#barcode-reader` id was confirmed out of scope (standalone phone-companion tool). Zero application code touched — pure documentation fix. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=15/after=15, both pre-existing advisory-only findings in unrelated `tools/*.html` files), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-master-reference-doc-sync-1.md](../docs/plans/debt-master-reference-doc-sync-1.md)) [Files: tools/SK8Lytz_App_Master_Reference.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md]

### Target: `main`
**Epic: Nomenclature Audit Engine (multi-phase: `fix/dead-ui-wiring` → `feat/nomenclature-registry` → `feat/nomenclature-audit-engine` → `debt/nomenclature-remediation` → `debt/brand-sweep`)**
*(Archived — 2026-07-23)*
*(Logged by `/idea_intake` — 2026-07-17)*
*Canonical naming authority & drift remediation engine. Fixes 3 live production dead-button bugs (Phase 0), establishes registry + scanner (Phases 1–2), shrinks baseline via triaged remediation (Phase 3), closes out with a scope decision on brand sweep + hook flip (Phase 4).*

#### 🔴 P1 — Dead Buttons & Unguarded Ghosts (Phase 0)
- [🚀] `fix/dead-ui-wiring` : **Production UI Wiring — Dead Buttons & Crashes** - Fix 3 live dead-button bugs (click_sortLtvModal ×6 headers, click_cancelRestore, click_actualNetSort_a) + guard/remove 7 unguarded ghost getElementById calls (inventory-module.js, packerz-module.js, print-module.js) that silently TypeError if the elements don't exist. These are production bugs found during nomenclature recon; ship immediately independent of the engine build. *Done — wired all 3 dead `data-click` tokens to their existing handler functions in `system-event-delegator.js` (emitters existed, delegator cases didn't); also removed a duplicate `ceo-module.js` click listener that would have double-fired `sortLtvModal()` once its delegator case was added (verified via direct testing: without the removal, same-column clicks appeared "stuck" instead of toggling). Guarded all 7 confirmed `getElementById` call sites in `inventory-module.js`/`packerz-module.js`; `print-module.js`'s unguarded accesses target elements that always exist in static markup and were left for Phase 3 (`debt/nomenclature-remediation`) to avoid scope creep. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/fix-dead-ui-wiring-1.md](../docs/plans/fix-dead-ui-wiring-1.md)) [Files: assets/js/system-event-delegator.js, assets/js/ceo-module.js, assets/js/inventory-module.js, assets/js/packerz-module.js, eslint.config.mjs]

#### 🟡 P2 — Registry & Scanner (Phases 1–2)
- [🚀] `feat/nomenclature-registry` : **Nomenclature Registry** - Extract the canonical naming inventory across 5 layers (L1 labels, L2 DOM/CSS, L3 functions, L4 DB/storage, L5 docs), user-ratify canonical names + rename-forbidden tags + dynamic-id allowlist patterns, generate tools/nomenclature-registry.json as the single machine authority, and auto-generate docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md. Sync Master Reference. *Done — built tools/nomenclature-registry.json (6 hubs, 9 legacy pane-id aliases, 3 function aliases, 1 token alias, 7 rename-forbidden families, 8 dynamic-id allowlist patterns) plus scripts/generate-nomenclature-dictionary.js to regenerate docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md deterministically, replacing a hand-maintained copy that had already drifted from the Master Reference. Recon also caught and fixed two pre-existing doc-only bugs: both the Master Reference and the old dictionary listed fictional "legacy" hub-tab DOM ids (`invhub-tab`, `prodhub-tab`, etc.) that never existed in code, and Master Reference §6B cited 3 non-existent NEXUZ pane ids (`paneNexuzBrainz/Importz/Salez` instead of the real `paneNexl*` ids) — both corrected against live grep evidence, ratified by user before write. User-ratified full 16-pane hub directory before implementation. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/feat-nomenclature-registry-1.md](../docs/plans/feat-nomenclature-registry-1.md)) [Files: tools/nomenclature-registry.json, tools/SK8Lytz_App_Master_Reference.md, docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md, scripts/generate-nomenclature-dictionary.js, package.json]
- [🚀] `feat/nomenclature-audit-engine` : **Nomenclature Audit Engine & Pre-Commit Integration** - Build scripts/nomenclature-audit.js (two-pass scanner with N1–N7 checks: ghost DOM lookups, orphan delegator tokens, L1 label drift, legacy-term occurrences, localStorage conformance, unused CSS, registry-docs sync). Implement three-way resolution (RESOLVED / PREFIX-MATCHED / UNRESOLVABLE) using regex + optional espree AST. Wire into .githooks/pre-commit in advisory (--warn) mode; capture baseline via scripts/nomenclature-baseline.json with monotonic-shrink enforcement. *Done — built the two-pass scanner (combined single-loop Pass 1 collector for perf, per-check Pass 2 resolvers) against the real shipped registry.json schema. N2 (orphan/dead delegator tokens) came back 0/0 — Phase 0's dead-button fix already resolved that category; N1 (ghost DOM lookups) is the dominant real category at 141+17. Caught and fixed a scanner defect during review: the N4 `Prod` legacy-term regex's negative lookbehind excluded camelCase segment starts (`paneProdBuilder` etc.), silently zeroing that category (78→85 findings after fix, re-baselined with `--force` since it was scanner-coverage growth, not new drift). Initial baseline: 358 findings (165 CRITICAL/103 MODERATE/90 ADVISORY) deduped to 216 line-independent fingerprints. Wired advisory-only into `.githooks/pre-commit` between the existing blocking XSS gate and version-bump — proven live: the batch's own commit ran the new hook and succeeded despite 250 changed-scope findings, confirming `--warn` truly never blocks. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/feat-nomenclature-audit-engine-1.md](../docs/plans/feat-nomenclature-audit-engine-1.md)) [Files: scripts/nomenclature-audit.js, scripts/nomenclature-baseline.json, .githooks/pre-commit, package.json, scripts/generate-nomenclature-dictionary.js]

#### 🟢 P3 — Triaged Remediation & Brand Sweep (Phases 3–4)
- [🚀] `debt/nomenclature-remediation` : **Nomenclature Remediation — Batched Tier 1 & Tier 2** - Shrink the baseline monotonically via risk-tiered batches. Tier 1: Replace legacy terms in comments/docstrings (Salez→STOCKPILEZ, Nexl→NEXUZ, neogleamz→sk8lytz, etc., ~30 refs). Tier 2: Delete 43 orphan delegator handlers, 87 unguarded ghost getElementById calls, ~100 unused CSS classes via triaged `/bucketlist` parallel batches (each batch verified via scanner baseline shrink). *In progress — Batch 1/N done: N6_UNUSED_CSS shrunk 90→29 findings. The N2 "43 orphan delegator handlers" estimate is stale (already 0 — resolved by Phase 0's `fix/dead-ui-wiring`). Live scanner counts as of this batch: N1_GHOST_ID 141 + N1_GHOST_ID_PREFIX 17 (Tier 2 remainder, not yet started), N4_LEGACY_TERM 85 (Tier 1 — discovered most of these are `documented-alias-do-not-rename` identifiers per tools/nomenclature-registry.json, e.g. `syncSalezStats`/`showSalezPane`/`showNexlPane`; the ledger's "~30 comment-only refs" framing undercounts and conflates protected aliases with genuine comment drift — needs its own scoped triage pass, not a blind rename), N5_NEW_NONCONFORMANT_KEY 24 (not yet started). Batch 1 also found the N6 scanner has real false positives (dynamic class construction via string concatenation/template literals and third-party library default classes it can't statically see) — 29 of the original 90 N6 findings are confirmed live and intentionally kept; see docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-1.md for full evidence. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.*
  - *Batch 2/N done — N5_NEW_NONCONFORMANT_KEY resolved 24→0 (and a bonus N7_DICT_STALE 1→0). This turned out to be a registry fix, not a code rename: `git log -S` on all 12 flagged localStorage keys (`theme`, `stockzLeftWidth`, `stockzTopHeight`, `NEOGLEAMZ_VER`, `neo_user_email`, `barcodzGroupState`, `recipeGroupState`, `fgiCategoryState`, `neoSnapshotLeftWidth`, `labelzGroupState`, `statImpzSyncs`, `lastBrainSync`) showed every one predates the sk8lytz_ prefix policy by 2-5 months — per the registry's own "existing_keys: Frozen — rename-forbidden wholesale" rule (`localstorage_policy`), all 12 are legacy and exempt. Renaming any of them in code would have silently reset persisted state (theme, saved panel widths, group-expand states, sync counters) for every returning user, since localStorage isn't migrated by a code-side rename. Added all 12 as `persistence`-coupled `rename_forbidden` entries in tools/nomenclature-registry.json instead, regenerated docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md. Zero application code changed. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-2.md for full evidence. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-2.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-2.md))
  - *Batch 3/N done — N1_GHOST_ID_PREFIX shrunk 17→9. Traced every one of the 17 findings for a real DOM producer instead of trusting the scanner; this category turned out to be a genuinely mixed bag, not a uniform "add guards" task: 4 patterns (`stockzAuditBtn_*`, `stockzAuditTab_*`, `sect-P-*`, `sect-*` — 8 findings) had real static producers in index.html and were pure registry gaps, added to `dynamic_id_allowlist` (same shape as Batch 2 — zero app-code risk). `sect-P-*` and `sect-*` are two DIFFERENT status enums (print-job vs. work-order) and were kept as separate entries on purpose. The remaining 9 prefix findings are NOT simple registry gaps: 4 (`inlineContainer_*`/`inlineLeftPane_*`/`inlineRightPane_*`/`inlinePreviewContainer_*`) trace to `window.initInlineResize`, a function with zero callers anywhere in the repo — an orphaned dead feature, already safely guarded against crashing, so "add a guard" doesn't even apply; this needs a delete-vs-keep decision, not a mechanical fix. 2 (`inlineSopQA_*`/`inlineSopQAPreview_*`) are wired dynamically through a button's `data-textid` attribute and need deeper call-chain tracing before a verdict. 3 (`sim-shipexp-*`/`sim-ghost-*`/`sim-net-*`) have no producer found but aren't yet confirmed orphaned either. Given how expensive per-item tracing proved to be (had to walk call chains across 3-4 files per finding), a future batch on the remaining N1_GHOST_ID_PREFIX (9) and N1_GHOST_ID (141, entirely unexplored) should dispatch the full pre-task swarm to do this tracing at scale rather than continue hand-verifying one by one in-session. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-3.md for full evidence. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.*
  - *Batch 4/N done — N1_GHOST_ID_PREFIX closed out 9→0 (and cleared a stale N7_DICT_STALE 1→0 left by Batch 3, which edited the registry but never committed the regenerated dictionary). Dispatched the full pre-task swarm as Batch 3 recommended; three-way resolution: (1) DELETED the `initInlineResize` trio (system-tools-module.js:2844-2886) — the explore-mapper's cited span was wrong, the 4 ghost-id reads actually live in companion `doInlineResize`, and `stopInlineResize` completes the trio; all three only reference each other and the sole entry point has zero callers repo-wide, so all 43 lines went. (2) DELETED 6 dead `let` declarations in sales-module.js:1494-1499 (`elCapture`…`elNet` — assigned from `sim-shipexp-`/`sim-ghost-`/`sim-net-` lookups, never read; `sim-shipexp-` was also a naming-mismatch fossil of the live hyphenated `sim-ship-exp-` lookup 40 lines below). (3) ALLOWLISTED `inlineSopQA_*`/`inlineSopQAPreview_*` as a dormant half-shipped feature, NOT dead code — reader `inlineRenderTelemetryPreview` is live, guarded, and gated on a `data-textid` prefix set by a live delegator handler, but the producer markup only ever existed in scripts/archive/ patch scripts. ⚠️ Major planner catch: Agent A (explore-mapper) reported the whole `cc*` Cycle Count Mobile Bridge cluster in inventory-module.js as dead/superseded by stockzAuditModal and recommended bulk deletion (~lines 1400-1900) — the implementation-planner's line-level trace proved `initializeCcSyncChannel`/`updateCCRouteUI`/`stopCycleCount`/`openCycleCountManager`/`updateCcMngrStock` are LIVE (called from `selectStockzAuditItem` at inventory-module.js:2324/2489; visible "📦 Cycle Counts" button at index.html:1902) — the old Manager UI was ripped out but its JS was reused to drive stockzAuditModal's remote-camera bridge. Bulk delete would have broken production. A verified-safe "Option B-lite" subset (9 truly-orphaned functions, ~12 N1_GHOST_ID findings, 3 non-contiguous excisions + 1 eslint global cleanup at eslint.config.mjs:259) was deferred by user decision to a future batch — see the Option B section of docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-4.md for the full function-by-function dead/live table. Baseline file deliberately NOT refreshed (Batches 1-4 precedent; shrink never blocks, only growth needs --force) — flag a future consolidated `chore(audit): refresh nomenclature baseline` at the next phase boundary. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-4.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-4.md))
  - *Batch 5/N done — executed the deferred Option B-lite: N1_GHOST_ID 141→109 (−32, nearly 3× the plan's −12 forecast — the scanner counts per-occurrence, not per-deduped-id, and the dead functions duplicated many DOM lookups that surviving live code also performs, so ids like `ccMngrItemSelect` 6→3 and `ccScannerStatusIndicator` 3→1 shed extra occurrences while remaining open) + bonus N4_LEGACY_TERM 85→84 (a deleted `ccMobileBridgeStatus` lookup carried the watchlisted "Bridge" term). Deleted the 9 verified-dead Cycle Count Mobile Bridge functions from inventory-module.js (3 non-contiguous spans + the `selectCcItem` dispatcher branch, 321 lines), 10 orphaned delegator cases from system-event-delegator.js (the plan enumerated 8; the implementer's post-deletion grep caught 2 more the Batch-4 analysis missed — `click_updateLocalIPQRCode_cc` and an UNGUARDED `keyup_window_filterCcMngrItems` — both zero-emitter-verified then removed as approved-scope completion), and the stale `selectCcMngrItem` eslint global. Live boundary functions `initializeCcSyncChannel`/`stopCycleCount`/`updateCCRouteUI` (the stockzAuditModal mobile-camera bridge) confirmed untouched — every span boundary re-read before cutting, pre-deletion re-verification found zero drift and zero new callers vs. Batch 4's analysis. Two scanner defects confirmed and deliberately NOT fixed mid-batch (document-and-defer precedent): (a) N7_DICT_STALE is a recurring CRLF false positive on Windows — `checkN7` does a raw byte compare while `core.autocrlf` rewrites docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md with CRLF on every checkout; verified content-identical after `\r\n` normalization (one-line fix: normalize both sides in checkN7); (b) N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER is structurally unable to fire on switch-case tokens — its indirect-match exemption scans the delegator file itself, so a `case 'token':` string literal self-satisfies the exemption. Both belong in a future scanner-hardening pass alongside the consolidated baseline refresh. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-5.md (incl. Execution Addendum) for full evidence. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-5.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-5.md))
  - *Batch 6/N done — the entire `packerz*` cluster cleared: N1_GHOST_ID 109→77 (−32). Three-way contradiction resolved during planning: the mapper called `loadPackerzSopFromDB` dead while Batch 5's testing guide had cited it live — planner's end-to-end trace proved TWO separate PACKERZ SOP surfaces exist: the live fullscreen 📝 PACKERZ SOP EDITOR (`openSOPMasterModal('packerz')` → shared `buildUnifiedSopLayoutHTML`) vs. a dead legacy "Packerz Admin Dashboard" whose anchor `packerzAdminRecipeSelect` has zero producer (every function permanently early-returns on Phase-0's null-guards). Deleted that dead cluster (368 contiguous lines, 6 functions incl. `openPackerzAuditLog` — zero callers, found incidentally), 6 orphaned delegator case tokens across 5 spans (5 planned + `click_closePackerzAuditOverlay`, newly orphaned because its only emitter lived inside the deleted function's own template — the same scanner-math trap the plan predicted for `packerzSopEditorRowsWrapper`), 3 stale eslint globals, 1 dangling realtime getGlobal entry, and the guarded residual `initPackerzAdmin()` call in index.html. In-function surgery (all provably-equivalent no-ops): ghost fallback chains in live `addPackerzSOPRow`/`checkPackerzSopSignoffState`, dead `packerzLiveSop*` block in live `doNeoSidebarResize`, dead `paneFulfillzSopAdmin` refs (4 spots), and — highest-risk — 3 boolean-simplified `sopModalWrapper` conditions inside live `executeSopPrint` (mapper wrongly called it dead; script load order makes production-module.js's definition the live BATCHEZ/LAYERZ print path; DOMPurify print-window sanitization verified untouched by the XSS validator). Allowlisted 3 ids genuinely produced by live `buildUnifiedSopLayoutHTML` (`packerzSopEditorArea`/`productionAdminQA`/`productionAdminQAPreview`) under a new `js-variable-literal` resolution_type — the id is a bare-variable interpolation with no static prefix, architecturally invisible to the scanner's template regex. ⚠️ DISCOVERED FUNCTIONAL BUG (not fixed — needs its own fix/* task): `buildUnifiedSopLayoutHTML`'s upload button never sets `data-prodid`, so PACKERZ SOP media uploads always file under `sops/packerz/unknown/` instead of the recipe folder (`triggerSopDirectUpload`, production-module.js:~352; 1 residual N1 finding left open there on purpose — fixing the ghost-id read without fixing the missing attribute would just swap silent failure modes). See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-6.md (incl. Execution Addendum) for full evidence. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-6.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-6.md))
  - *Batch 7/N done — N1_GHOST_ID 77→24 (−53, biggest single-batch shrink of the epic). Discovered and resolved the largest previously-unexplored chunk: a "Regex/Parcel Preset Playground" admin feature (system-tools-module.js, order-parsing + parcel-parsing regex config with a live test playground) — the explore-mapper initially called ALL ~27 of its ids real producers, but the implementation-planner's independent re-trace found 23 genuinely real (allowlisted via 2 efficient family-pattern regex entries, not 23 individual ones — `dynamic_id_allowlist` stays lean) and 4 genuinely fake, the latter tied to **two currently-live bugs the mapper missed entirely**: `getCurrentUIRules()` reads nonexistent `regexPostage`/`regexMakeup` (real ids are `regexFeeStructure`/`regexSecondaryFee`) — **this crashes every Apply/Save/Overwrite click on the Orderz side of the Regex Playground today** (`TypeError` on `null.value`); `renderParcelPresetDropdown()` reads nonexistent `btnDeleteParcelPreset`/`btnOverwriteParcelPreset` (real shared ids are `btnDeletePreset`/`btnOverwritePreset`) — Parcelz Delete/Overwrite preset buttons silently never appear. Both left untouched (leave-as-finding, user-approved) — logged as a new fix/* task below. Also caught a **systematic mapper-hallucinated-function-name pattern**: the mapper named 5 different containing functions for its "misc singles" findings, and every single name was fabricated (e.g. claimed `renderSocialzTable()`, real function is `renderSkaters()`) — the identifiers/line numbers were accurate, the function names were not; flagged for future batches to never trust mapper-cited function names without independent grep. Deleted 4 fully-dead functions (`openBackupModal`/`closeBackupModal` — zero callers despite a stale CSS selector suggesting the modal once existed; `runProductionBatch` — superseded by the live Work Order system; `initVerticalResizer`, 62 lines — leftover from a pre-refactor vertical STOCKZ layout, live layout uses the horizontal `stockz-h-resizer` instead) plus 6 in-function surgeries removing guarded-always-false dead reads from live `renderSkaters()`/`updateLaborCosts()`/`renderWOList()`/`renderActiveWO()`/`teOpenTaskContext()` (the `renderWOList()` fix required also removing an orphaned `totalUnits` accumulator the plan itself missed — same class of risk it had explicitly caught in a sibling case, corrected by the implementer under the same fix category). Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-7.md for full evidence.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-7.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-7.md))
  - *Batch 8/N done — N4_LEGACY_TERM fully triaged (84 findings, zero left unexplored) + tiny N1 bonus fix (22→20). **Critical scanner-mechanics discovery, load-bearing for Phase 4 below:** read `checkN4` in full — it consults exactly one registry field (`legacy_term_watchlist`'s term/match_scope) and NEVER reads `rename_forbidden`/`legacy_function_aliases`/`legacy_token_aliases`/`hubs.*.panes`/`dynamic_id_allowlist`. **N4 has zero per-identifier suppression mechanism, unlike N1's allowlist — documenting an identifier as a protected alias does not and cannot clear its N4 finding.** Confirmed empirically: registry edited, dictionary regenerated, N4 stayed byte-for-byte identical at 84 before/after. Of the 84: 61 are genuinely already registry-documented (independently re-verified against the literal JSON, not the explore-mapper's report — which claimed 74 and was wrong on 13, including a self-contradicting hedge on its own "Category A" label for the `statSalz*` cluster), 21 were real registry-documentation gaps now closed (`statSalz*` 5-id KPI cluster, `btnSalezImport*` 2-button pair the mapper incorrectly couldn't verify as live, `active*Pane` 6-key sessionStorage family under a new `session_persistence` coupling_type), 2 are the already-known deferred `cc*` cluster (untouched), 0 are safe rename candidates. Also corrected 6 stale `index.html` line citations that had drifted non-uniformly (149-213 lines) since the registry's 2026-07-17 ratification, and closed the `regexSecondaryFee`/`regexGroupWeight` N1 follow-up flagged by `fix/regex-playground-preset-bugs` (family-pattern extension, N1_GHOST_ID 22→20). Zero application code touched — pure registry + regenerated dictionary. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.

  - *Batch 9/N done — the highest-stakes batch of the epic to date, resolving the `cc*` Cycle Count Mobile Bridge cluster flagged since Batch 8 as needing its own dedicated plan: N1_GHOST_ID 20→13 (−7). Of the 19 findings, only 7 turned out to be genuinely dead code — deleted this batch: `ccMobileBridgeStatus` (MOBILE_CONNECT, no modern text-status equivalent was ever built), `ccRemotePreviewScreen` (REMOTE_FRAME_STREAM, confirmed redundant — its modern sibling `stockzAuditMobilePreviewScreen` is already updated 2 lines below in the same handler), `ccMngrItemSelect`/`ccMngrQtyInput` (MOBILE_SAVE_COUNT else-branch, doubly dead — the `saveManualCycleCount()` it called has zero definition anywhere in the repo), `barcode-reader`/`inlineCycleScannerCard` (stopCycleCount, real cleanup already happens via the immediately-following `closeCycleCountManager()`→`closeStockzAuditModal()` chain), and `scanner-success-flash` (onScanSuccess, no modern equivalent element was ever built). **The other 12 findings are symptoms of 5 real, live bugs in the shipped phone-QR-scan bridge feature** (stockzAuditModal → 📷 SCAN PORTAL → 📱 Smartphone Link), left untouched and logged as `fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs` below: the connection-status dot never turns green, the QR code doesn't auto-hide on connect, the phone's manual item dropdown is always empty, phone-side item selection never syncs to the PC (compounding into a **silent data-loss path** — a mismatched save just no-ops with zero error on either device), and a confirmed-100%-dead 3-way preview-routing function (`updateCCRouteUI`) whose disposition (delete vs. restore) needs explicit product sign-off, not a nomenclature-cleanup judgment call. Also flagged a stale Master Reference doc-drift (`cycleCountManagerModal`/`#barcode-reader` references at Master Reference lines 561/591 no longer describe live DOM) for a small future doc-sync pass, logged under Technical Debt below. **Process note:** the implementation-planner agent producing this batch's plan hit the account's session usage limit mid-run and reported as failed — but had already fully written `docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md` to disk before terminating. Rather than re-dispatch (risking an immediate repeat failure), the recovered plan's most load-bearing claims were independently re-verified directly against source before trusting and executing it (REMOTE_FRAME_STREAM's dual old/new DOM write, MOBILE_PREVIEW_MODE_CHANGED's manual-phone-tap-only send path, `ccLocalQrScanner`'s permanent-null state, `saveManualCycleCount`'s total absence of any definition, `stockzAuditScannerStatusIndicator`'s zero-JS-writer status, and its cited design-doc/Master-Reference line citations) — every checked claim held. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md for full evidence.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md))
  - *Batch 10/N done — N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER fully resolved 35→0 (first batch with visibility into this category at all, since `chore/nomenclature-scanner-hardening`'s N2 self-match fix only just revealed it) + N1_GHOST_ID 2→1 (`pcRouteBar` closed). Triaged all 35 case-by-case rather than blind-deleting: **8 fully dead end-to-end** (case + handler function both deleted — `click_openTaskContext`, 3 pre-unification Packerz row-move handlers superseded by the unified `moveSOPUp`/`moveSOPDown`/`removeSOPRow`, `click_openSOPSnapshotCamera_packerz`, `openPrintSOP` (superseded by `openSopPrintModal`), `teUpdateTaskCycle` (its sole UI trigger was already deleted as dead scaffolding in Batch 7), `teChangeIdentity` (self-documented `console.warn("...is deprecated")`)); **16 case-only deletions** where the handler function stays live via a genuinely different real path (direct JS call or another live delegator case — e.g. `click_window_closeCycleCountManager`'s case is dead but `window.closeCycleCountManager()` itself is still called internally); **11 case-only deletions** where the called function never existed anywhere in the repo (doubly-dead: zero emitter AND zero definition — includes the 5 `blur_window_handleCcMngrTelemetryEd*` variants and `click_window_saveManualCycleCount`, independently re-confirming Batch 9's own "zero definition anywhere" finding for that same function). The implementation-planner caught and corrected **3 explore-mapper errors** during independent re-verification (full detail in the plan's §1) — most notably, `click_openSOPSnapshotCamera_smart` was wrongly called "fully dead" when it's actually live via a second delegator case (`mousedown_smartPhotoPaste`) with a real emitter; had this gone unverified, a live camera-snapshot button would have broken. **Zero new functional bugs discovered** — every one of the 35 was confirmed unreachable by any live UI path today, so none needed the "flag as separate fix/* task" treatment this epic has used before (Batches 7/9). `pcRouteBar` (inventory-module.js) was the one fragment the already-shipped, user-approved `updateCCRouteUI()` wholesale deletion (`fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs`, Finding 5) missed, since it lives in a different function (`MOBILE_CONNECT`) — deleted now that the parent feature's deletion is confirmed fully shipped. `packerzAdminRecipeSelect` re-confirmed unguarded on purpose per Batch 6's reasoning, no action. User-approved bundle of 2 small Boy-Scout items caused directly by this batch's own deletions: 3 now-stale ESLint globals removed (`openMediaManager`/`openPrintSOP`/`printPackerzSOP`), 1 Master Reference doc-drift line corrected (was misattributing a function call to the now-deleted `openPrintSOP`). User also approved deleting `click_window_saveManualCycleCount` outright rather than preserving Batch 5's older "stays, documented" language, since this batch's evidence (zero emitter + zero definition, independently re-verified) is stronger than what justified the original "stays" posture. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=15/after=15, both counts entirely pre-existing advisory-only findings in unrelated `tools/*.html` files — `system-event-delegator.js` has zero HTML-sink call sites at all, so this batch carried zero XSS risk by construction), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-10.md for full evidence.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-10.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-10.md))
  - *Batch 11/N done — final batch, N3_LABEL_DRIFT resolved 1→0 (the last untriaged nomenclature-audit category). `index.html:3208`'s SOCIALZ hub pane header read "SOCIALZ AUDIENCE" but the ratified canonical label in `tools/nomenclature-registry.json:68` and the Master Reference's own Mermaid diagram (both already said "ROSTER") had drifted from the live HTML — a one-line static text-node fix, zero blast radius confirmed via full-repo grep (no JS text-matching, no CSS selector, no other doc depended on the old string), no dynamic re-render path that could have reintroduced it. **This closes out the task.** Cross-referencing every nomenclature-audit category as of this batch: N1_GHOST_ID 1 (`packerzAdminRecipeSelect`, deliberately unguarded, tied to a separate bug — documented exception, not a scanner limitation), N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER 0, N3_LABEL_DRIFT 0, N4_LEGACY_TERM 84 (documented permanent floor, explicitly owned by `debt/brand-sweep` below), N5_NEW_NONCONFORMANT_KEY 0, N6_UNUSED_CSS 29 (confirmed real scanner false positives, not remediable code debt — Batch 1), N7_DICT_STALE 0. Every category is now either a genuine zero or an explicitly evidenced, owned permanent floor — none left unexamined. User-approved marking this task `[x]` on this basis; task's own scope was "triaged remediation," not "reach absolute zero." Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=15/after=15, both pre-existing advisory-only in unrelated `tools/*.html` files), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings. See docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-11.md for full evidence.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-11.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-11.md))
  - *⚠️ Phase 4 (`debt/brand-sweep`) blocker flagged by Batch 8's discovery above: that task's stated goal is "scanner now enforces zero baseline findings on every commit" once the pre-commit hook flips to blocking — but N4_LEGACY_TERM cannot reach 0 without renaming all 61+ documented-alias identifiers this epic has consistently declined to rename (D2 precedent: document, don't touch live wired code), and the `cc*` in-function-surgery cluster (~19 N1 findings) is similarly resistant to full closure. Flipping the hook to blocking as currently scoped would fail every future commit. Needs a decision before Phase 4 starts: either (a) scope the blocking gate to a subset of rules (e.g. N1/N6/N7 only, exclude N4), (b) add an N4 suppression mechanism to `checkN4` mirroring N1's `dynamic_id_allowlist` (a scanner-hardening change, not content), or (c) accept a non-zero permanent floor and gate on "no *new* findings" (delta-based) instead of an absolute zero. Bundle with the standing scanner-hardening micro-task (N7 CRLF normalization, N2 self-match exemption bug) and the consolidated `chore(audit): refresh nomenclature baseline` — all three are pre-work for Phase 4, not Phase 4 itself.*
  - *Task complete as of Batch 11. Final state: N1_GHOST_ID 1 (`packerzAdminRecipeSelect`, deliberately unguarded, documented exception), N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER 0, N3_LABEL_DRIFT 0, N4_LEGACY_TERM 84 (documented permanent floor, owned by `debt/brand-sweep` below), N5_NEW_NONCONFORMANT_KEY 0, N6_UNUSED_CSS 29 (confirmed real scanner false positives, not code debt), N7_DICT_STALE 0. The `cc*` Cycle Count Mobile Bridge cluster's live-bug remainder is fully closed (`fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs`, archived). This Epic (Nomenclature Audit Engine) remains active — not yet archived — pending `debt/brand-sweep` below, which now owns the N4 permanent-floor gate-scoping decision and the neogleamz→sk8lytz rename sweep.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-1.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-1.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-3.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-3.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-4.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-4.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-7.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-7.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-8.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-8.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-10.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-10.md), [docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-11.md](../docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-11.md), [docs/plans/nomenclature-audit-engine.md](../docs/plans/nomenclature-audit-engine.md)) [Files: assets/js/system-event-delegator.js, assets/js/inventory-module.js, assets/js/packerz-module.js, assets/js/production-module.js, assets/js/print-module.js, assets/js/system-tools-module.js, assets/js/sales-module.js, assets/js/socialz-module.js, assets/js/bom-module.js, assets/js/task-engine.js, index.html, qa-dashboard.html, docs/nomenclature_dictionary.md, tools/nomenclature-registry.json]
- [🚀] `chore/nomenclature-scanner-hardening` : **Nomenclature Scanner Hardening** - Bundle of 3 scanner-code fixes to `scripts/nomenclature-audit.js`, discovered and deferred across Batches 5 and 8: (1) **N4 has zero registry-suppression mechanism** — `checkN4` never reads `rename_forbidden`/`legacy_function_aliases`/etc., so documenting an alias can never clear its N4 finding; this is a load-bearing blocker for `debt/brand-sweep` below (its "zero baseline findings" blocking-gate goal is unreachable while N4's 61+ documented-alias findings form a permanent floor) — needs a design decision (add an N4 suppression path vs. scope the blocking gate to exclude N4 vs. switch to a delta-based "no new findings" gate) before implementation. (2) N7_DICT_STALE recurring Windows CRLF false positive — `checkN7` does a raw byte compare while `core.autocrlf` rewrites the dictionary with CRLF on every checkout. (3) N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER structurally cannot fire on switch-case tokens — its indirect-match exemption scans the delegator file itself, so a `case 'token':` label self-satisfies the check. *Done — Items 2 and 3 shipped as planned: `checkN7` now normalizes `\r\n`→`\n` on both sides before comparing (this machine's real `core.autocrlf=true` was live-reproducing the false positive, not a hypothetical — confirmed via a genuine CRLF round-trip, then confirmed real staleness still fires correctly post-fix); `checkN2` now excludes `system-event-delegator.js`'s own `case '...':` label strings from the `allStringLiterals` pool its indirect-match exemption checks. **Item 1: user chose Option B** (scope the gate instead of teaching `checkN4` the registry) — the planner found Option A would actually need two different suppression mechanisms glued together (line-citation parsing for 3 registry containers, identifier-matching for `hubs.*.panes` since those have no parseable line citations), not the one uniform mechanism originally assumed. `checkN4` is untouched; the actual N4-gate-scoping work now belongs to `debt/brand-sweep` below, not this task. **Significant side discovery:** fixing Item 3 surfaced 35 real, previously-invisible `N2_ORPHAN_HANDLER` findings (0→35) — logged in `debt/nomenclature-remediation`'s Remaining note above for future triage; also discovered N2 (unlike N4/N5) isn't gated by `--changed-only`, so all 35 will print on every future commit going forward (still non-blocking, `--warn` mode unaffected). Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0, no DOM/browser surface in scope), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/chore-nomenclature-scanner-hardening-1.md](../docs/plans/chore-nomenclature-scanner-hardening-1.md)) [Files: scripts/nomenclature-audit.js]
- [🚀] `debt/brand-sweep` : **Brand Sweep & Hook Flip to Blocking** - ~~Complete neogleamz→sk8lytz rename across 88 refs (comments, docstrings, localStorage key prefixes, paths, file names with cache-buster coordination). Flip .githooks/pre-commit from advisory (--warn) to blocking (remove --warn flag); scanner now enforces zero baseline findings on every commit.~~ *Closed without implementation — 2026-07-23, by explicit user decision, before any code was touched. A `/bucketlist` pre-task swarm (explore-mapper + implementation-planner) fully scoped this task first: recon found the "88 refs" were almost entirely internal code plumbing (a physical file rename of `assets/js/neogleamz-engine.js`, 2 global-variable renames, Realtime channel-name strings, code comments) plus several items that were live infrastructure and correctly out of scope regardless of this task's disposition (the real `neogleamz.com` CDN domain, real team-member emails in `task-engine.js`, the live Supabase `neogleamz_name`/`neogleamz_product` columns feeding `full_landed_costs`). User then clarified the actual original intent behind logging this task was tab/page **label** accuracy, not an internal source-identifier rename — and confirmed that goal is already fully satisfied: no hub/tab/pane label anywhere reads "Neogleamz" today (all already SK8Lytz-styled — STOCKPILEZ/MAKERZ/FULFILLZ/REVENUEZ/NEXUZ/etc.), and the one real label-drift bug that existed (the SOCIALZ tab reading "AUDIENCE" instead of the ratified "ROSTER") was already fixed above in `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 11. User explicitly declined the internal-identifier rename sweep and the hook-flip-to-blocking (the N4/N2 permanent-floor gating decision is therefore also left unresolved — not needed unless a future task revives the hook flip on its own merits). **No files were changed; `.githooks/pre-commit` remains in advisory (`--warn`) mode.** The throwaway plan (`docs/plans/debt-brand-sweep-1.md`) and its scratch branch were discarded, not committed — nothing to link here.* [Files: none — closed pre-implementation]

*Logged by `/idea_intake` during `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 7's discovery — 2026-07-19.*

#### 🔴 P0 — Crash + Hidden Buttons
- [🚀] `fix/regex-playground-preset-bugs` : **Regex/Parcel Preset Playground — Crash + Hidden Buttons** - Two naming-mismatch bugs discovered during `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 7's nomenclature trace (not fixed there — out of that batch's scope). **Bug 1 (CRITICAL, crash):** `getCurrentUIRules()` (system-tools-module.js:114-115) reads nonexistent DOM ids `regexPostage`/`regexMakeup` (real ids are `regexFeeStructure`/`regexSecondaryFee`) — every click of "✅ Apply Active Rules," "💾 Save As New," or "🔄 Overwrite" on the **Orderz** side of the Regex Playground threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')`. **Bug 2 (MEDIUM, silent):** `renderParcelPresetDropdown()` (system-tools-module.js:452-453) read nonexistent `btnDeleteParcelPreset`/`btnOverwriteParcelPreset` (real shared ids are `btnDeletePreset`/`btnOverwritePreset`) — Delete/Overwrite buttons never appeared on the **Parcelz** side. *Done — user opted to bundle the optional Bug 3 too (`getCurrentParcelUIRules()` was silently omitting `regexGroupWeight` from saved rules, masked by a load-time default-backfill). All 3 fixed via 4 corrected `getElementById` target strings + 1 new object-property line, single file. Independent re-verification (fresh explore-mapper + planner pass) confirmed every line number and call chain from the original discovery still held. Nomenclature side effect: N1_GHOST_ID 24→22 (not the predicted →20) — fixing the ghost reads correctly cleared 4 old findings, but pointing `getElementById` at `regexSecondaryFee`/`regexGroupWeight` for the first time surfaced 2 NEW findings, because `tools/nomenclature-registry.json`'s Batch-7 allowlist regex family includes `FeeStructure` as a recognized alternation but not `SecondaryFee`/`GroupWeight` — both have real confirmed producers, this is a registry-completeness gap, not a new bug. ⚠️ Follow-up flagged for a future `debt/nomenclature-remediation` batch: add `SecondaryFee`/`GroupWeight` to that allowlist pattern. Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/fix-regex-playground-preset-bugs.md](../docs/plans/fix-regex-playground-preset-bugs.md)) [Files: assets/js/system-tools-module.js]

*Logged by `/health_check` sweep — 2026-07-02. Executed as a 2-task parallel batch on `debt/hygiene` (commit `d4772cd`). Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0, blocking mode exit 0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.*

#### 🟡 Low — Hygiene
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[index.html:6353–6359](../index.html)** — seven orphaned section-header comments (`// --- 6. BULK MODAL ---` through `// --- 13. NEW BACKUP & RESTORE SYSTEM ---`) sit at the tail of the inline `<script>` with no code beneath them — fossils from when those sections were extracted into `assets/js/*` modules. Delete the seven comment lines. *Done — all 7 fossil lines removed; confirmed the same headers remain legitimately active in bom-module.js, inventory-module.js, sales-module.js, production-module.js, and system-tools-module.js (untouched).* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt/hygiene-1.md](../docs/plans/debt/hygiene-1.md)) [Files: index.html]
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[.claude/settings.json](../.claude/settings.json)** — committed permission allowlist contains one-shot session grants (awk commands pinned to now-stale line numbers of packerz-module.js, a one-off grep, an echo). Prune to the durable entries only (`git checkout *`, `git pull *`, xss-audit) so the shared settings file stays curated. *Done — pruned from 9 entries to 3 durable ones; the removed malformed `node -e ' *` fragment was flagged as the highest-value removal (effectively-unscoped arbitrary JS execution grant).* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt/hygiene-2.md](../docs/plans/debt/hygiene-2.md)) [Files: .claude/settings.json]

#### 🟠 Moderate — Tooling
- [🚀] `debt/tooling` : **[.githooks/pre-commit:33](../.githooks/pre-commit)** — XSS audit gate still runs in `--warn` (advisory) mode, but the codebase has reached **0 violations**. Per the hook's own comment, remove `--warn` to make the gate blocking so new violations can never be committed. *Done — `--warn` removed, comment updated to blocking mode; the batch commit itself exercised the blocking gate live and passed.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt/tooling-1.md](../docs/plans/debt/tooling-1.md)) [Files: .githooks/pre-commit]

#### 🟡 Low — Dead Code
- [🚀] `debt/dead-code` : **[sales-module.js:51](../assets/js/sales-module.js)** — `addManualSale()` is a fully orphaned feature remnant: zero callers, no `data-click` token, and the `manualSale*` form inputs it reads no longer exist anywhere in the DOM. Companion no-op at **[index.html:6349](../index.html)** populates the nonexistent `#manualSaleRecipe` dropdown (silently skipped via `if(manualDrop)` guard). Decide: delete both remnants, or rebuild/re-wire the Manual Sale entry form in REVENUEZ. *Done — DELETE option chosen: removed the 66-line function (old lines 51–116) and the 3-line populator block (old index.html 6348–6350); live `populateDropdowns()` and SALEZ CSV import flow verified intact.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt/tooling-2.md](../docs/plans/debt/tooling-2.md)) [Files: assets/js/sales-module.js, index.html]
- [🚀] `debt/dead-code` : **[packerz-module.js:213](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** — `findDynamicShopifyVariant()` has zero callers repo-wide and carries an `eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars` suppression masking the fact. Delete the function and its suppression comment (or wire it into the alias-matching flow if it was meant to ship). *Done — DELETE option chosen: removed 41 lines (old 211–251) including the explanatory + eslint-disable comments; surviving barcode helpers `getDeterministic9DigitHash`/`getItemBarcodeValue` verified via 14/14 parity tests.* (Plan: [docs/plans/debt/tooling-3.md](../docs/plans/debt/tooling-3.md)) [Files: assets/js/packerz-module.js]

- [🚀] `feat/recipez-search-filter` : **RECIPEZ Search Filter** - Add a live-filter search box to the RECIPEZ sidebar so users can type to instantly narrow the recipe list by substring (e.g., typing "Haloz" shows only recipes containing "Haloz"). Real-time filtering, case-insensitive, works across all categories (RETAIL, SUB-ASSEMBLIES, 3D PRINTS, CUSTOM LABELS). Implemented via `#recipeSearchInput` + `window.filterRecipeList()` display-toggling (no innerHTML — zero new XSS surface), wired through the `data-input` delegator, with a zero-refresh hook inside `renderProductList()` so the filter survives every list re-render. Note: ledger originally declared `production-module.js`, but the recipe list renderer actually lives in `bom-module.js` (verified by grep during planning).

### Target: `debt/security` + `debt/hygiene`
**Epic: Technical Debt Sweep — Security Hardening + DOM Hygiene (Full)**
*(Archived — 2026-07-01)*

#### 🔴 Critical — Unguarded DOM Injection (no safeHTML at all)
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[index.html:4408](../index.html)** — `sysLog()` debug logger calls `insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', ...)` with raw `${msg}` and `${htmlPayload}`. `msg` is passed by `window.onerror`, unhandled promise rejections (`event.reason`), and all `catch(e)` blocks across the app — any of these can carry DB-sourced or externally-influenced strings. `htmlPayload` is `JSON.stringify(payload)` which does not HTML-escape. No `window.safeHTML()` anywhere in the call path. Wrap both variables before insertion.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[barcodz-module.js:485](../assets/js/barcodz-module.js)** — print confirmation modal: `modalEl.innerHTML = innerHtml` where `innerHtml` interpolates `${activeSizeSelect}` (DB-populated dropdown value, unsanitized). Attribute-escape attack vector. Wrap in `window.safeHTML(...)`.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[label-designer.js:708](../assets/js/label-designer.js)** — print confirmation modal: `modalEl.innerHTML = innerHtml` where `innerHtml` interpolates `${window.ldState.paperProfile}` (user-saved label profile name, unsanitized). Same attribute-escape vector. Wrap in `window.safeHTML(...)`.

#### 🔴 Critical — Systemic: Ternary safeHTML Fallback (38 DOM-write instances in index.html)
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[index.html — 38 instances](../index.html)** — Pattern `window.safeHTML ? window.safeHTML(x) : x` throughout the inline script. If `neogleamz-engine.js` fails to load (network error, script error), `window.safeHTML` is `undefined` and every fallback branch injects raw HTML. High-risk fallback sites include: L5461 (recipe names from DB), L5861 (DB column keys in button HTML), L5918/6016 (full DB table rows), L6303–6319 (product name dropdowns from DB), L4855/7002/7068 (Supabase error messages). Replace all 38 with unconditional `window.safeHTML(x)` calls — the function itself already has an `innerText` escape fallback if DOMPurify is absent.

#### 🔴 Critical — Systemic: Ternary safeHTML Fallback (38 remaining instances across 6 modules)

#### 🟠 Moderate — Unguarded Print Window document.write (DB data flows unescaped)
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[production-module.js:2545–2626](../assets/js/production-module.js)** — SOP print window pipes `globalRichTextHTML` (raw rich-text HTML from DB) and `s.text` (SOP step text from DB) into `win.document.write(html)` with no sanitization. An admin-inserted `<script>` in an SOP step executes in the same-origin print popup.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[packerz-module.js:925–1008](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** — SOP print window pipes `pName` (recipe name from DB), `s.text`, and `s.qaChecks` (SOP step/QA text from DB) into `win.document.write(html)` unguarded.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[print-module.js:880–956](../assets/js/print-module.js)** — SOP print window pipes `s.text` and header content from DB SOP steps into `win.document.write(html)` unguarded.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[inventory-module.js:1091–1097](../assets/js/inventory-module.js)** — Reorder report print window pipes `x.nn` (neogleamz name), `x.n` (item name), `x.sp` (spec) from DB into `win.document.write(html)` unguarded.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[production-module.js:2419–2425](../assets/js/production-module.js)** — Work order print window pipes `name` and product names from DB into `win.document.write(html)` unguarded. Fix pattern for all five: run `DOMPurify.sanitize(html)` on the assembled string before passing to `document.write`, or switch to `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL`.

#### 🟠 Moderate — DOMPurify as Last Line of Defense (free-text DB fields reach safeHTML)
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[inventory-module.js:3116–3162](../assets/js/inventory-module.js)** — `refreshStockzAuditHistory()` concatenates raw DB fields `row.reason_code`, `row.operator_email`, and `row.notes` (free-text form input) directly into the HTML string `h` before calling `window.safeHTML(h)`. DOMPurify is the only protection. Add a text-escape helper for free-text fields before concatenation so DOMPurify isn't a single point of failure for stored-XSS.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[socialz-module.js:788, 814](../assets/js/socialz-module.js)** — `log()` function embeds `s.name` (skater name from Supabase) into `msg` and then into `term.innerHTML` via the ternary fallback. If DOMPurify is absent, a malicious skater name in the DB executes as HTML in the socialz terminal.

#### 🟠 Hygiene — Inline Event Handlers (CLAUDE.md violation)
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[index.html:2653](../index.html)**, **[index.html:2712](../index.html)**, **[index.html:2822](../index.html)** — three `<select>` elements (`#barcodzTemplateSelect`, `#labelzTemplateSelect`, `#labelzDesignerTemplateSelect`) use `onchange=""` inline attribute handlers. Convert all three to `data-change` tokens registered in `system-event-delegator.js`.
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[bom-module.js:38](../assets/js/bom-module.js)** — inline `onclick="document.getElementById('bulkAddModal').style.display='none';"` baked into a dynamically built `<tr>`. Replace with a `data-click` delegator token.
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[packerz-module.js:163](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** and **[packerz-module.js:2489](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** — redundant `onclick="event.stopPropagation()"` alongside `data-app-click="stopProp"` (which already works). Remove the inline `onclick=` attributes.

#### 🟠 Infrastructure — No SRI on CDN Scripts + CSP Gaps
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[index.html:11–17](../index.html)** — None of the 7 CDN `<script>` tags (including DOMPurify itself) carry an `integrity="sha384-..."` SRI hash. A compromised CDN could serve a malicious DOMPurify that bypasses all safeHTML calls. Add SRI hashes to all CDN scripts.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[index.html:6](../index.html)** — CSP `script-src` includes both `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`, which nullifies XSS injection protection entirely (required by the inline-script architecture). Long-term: extract the inline `<script>` block to an external file to allow `'unsafe-inline'` removal. Short-term: add a `report-uri` directive so violations are visible. *(Note: `report-uri` in a `<meta>` tag is silently ignored per W3C CSP spec §7.1 — documented in-code; requires HTTP header control to implement.)*
- [🚀] `debt/hygiene` : **[index.html:6](../index.html)** — Dev/sandbox `connect-src` URLs (`http://127.0.0.1:54321`, `ws://127.0.0.1:54321`) are present in the production CSP. Remove from production.

#### 🟡 Low — outerHTML with e.message (browser-controlled, low risk)
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[packerz-module.js:1734, 1742](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** and **[production-module.js:2763, 2769](../assets/js/production-module.js)** — `el.outerHTML = \`...\${e.message}\`` in barcode/QR error handlers. `e.message` is JS Error.message (browser-controlled, unlikely to carry injection), but should be escaped for correctness. Replace with `textContent` on a created element.

### Target: `main`
**Epic: Technical Debt Sweep**
*(Archived — 2026-07-01)*

#### 🔴 Security
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[packerz-module.js:1581](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** — `insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', window.safeHTML ? window.safeHTML(h) : h)` — the ternary fallback `: h` injects raw unguarded HTML if `window.safeHTML` is undefined. Hardened to early-return with console error if safeHTML unavailable.

#### 🟡 Hygiene
- [🚀] `chore/hygiene` : Add `coverage/` to [.gitignore](../.gitignore) — test artifacts (`clover.xml`, `lcov.info`, HTML coverage reports) are currently tracked and deploy to the live GitHub Pages site on every push.

#### 🟢 Dependencies
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : `exceljs` removed entirely — runtime unused (all Excel I/O uses SheetJS). Removal eliminates the `uuid` moderate vulnerability at the root. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities.

### Target: `main`
**Epic: Technical Debt Sweep**
*(Archived — 2026-06-30)*

#### 🔴 Security: Unguarded innerHTML
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[inventory-module.js:3162](../assets/js/inventory-module.js)** — `historyContainer.innerHTML = h` — `h` is built from database rows including `row.notes` (user-supplied text). Wrap in `window.safeHTML()`.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[inventory-module.js:3172](../assets/js/inventory-module.js)** — `historyContainer.innerHTML = \`...$\{e.message}\`` — error message injected into DOM without sanitization. Wrap template in `window.safeHTML()`.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[label-designer.js:78](../assets/js/label-designer.js)** — `sel.innerHTML = html` — `html` is built from database template names/IDs. Wrap in `window.safeHTML()`.
- [🚀] `debt/security` : **[packerz-module.js:3479](../assets/js/packerz-module.js)** — `card.innerHTML` injects `imageUrl` into `src` AND an inline `onclick` handler — double violation (unguarded innerHTML + forbidden inline event handler). Refactor to use `data-click` token and `window.safeHTML()`.

#### 🔴 Vulnerabilities (npm audit — resolved)
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : **fabric@5.5.2 → 7.4.0** — HIGH severity stored XSS via SVG export (GHSA-hfvx-25r5-qc3w, GHSA-w22m-hvvm-xmwx). Run `npm audit fix --force` — **BREAKING CHANGE**, audit fabric 7.x API diff before upgrading.
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : **tar (via @mapbox/node-pre-gyp)** — HIGH severity path traversal (6 CVEs). Run `npm audit fix` — non-breaking, safe to run.
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : **uuid < 11.1.1 (via exceljs)** — MODERATE, missing buffer bounds check. Requires `npm audit fix --force` (downgrades exceljs to 3.4.0).

#### 🟡 Stale Packages (resolved)
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : `eslint` 10.4.1 → 10.6.0 (patch — safe)
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : `prettier` 3.8.3 → 3.9.4 (patch — safe)
- [🚀] `debt/dependencies` : `supabase` 2.104.0 → 2.109.0 (minor — safe)

**Epic: Mobile Bridge & Print Report Stored-XSS Remediation (branches `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss`, `fix/print-reorder-report-document-write-xss`)**
*(Archived — 2026-07-21)*
*Two sibling Critical stored-XSS fixes surfaced in sequence during `fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs`'s pre-task security scout and `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss`'s own post-implementation validation sweep — 2026-07-20.*

#### 🔴 P0 — Critical (Blockers & Hotfixes)
- [🚀] `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss` : **Stored XSS — Mobile Bridge History Broadcast** - Critical stored-XSS vulnerability discovered 2026-07-20 during `fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs`'s pre-task security scout. `tools/remote-scanner.html:1123`'s `PC_HISTORY_UPDATE` broadcast handler does `histContainer.innerHTML = payload.html;` with zero sanitization, and this file loads no `window.safeHTML`/DOMPurify at all. The raw, unsanitized `payload.html` is sent from `assets/js/inventory-module.js:2778` (`window.refreshStockzAuditHistory`) — which broadcasts the *un-sanitized* version of a string (`h`) that embeds unescaped operator-typed `notes`, `reason_code`, `operator_email`, and item display name, even though the PC's own local render of that same string (line 2773) IS correctly wrapped in `window.safeHTML(...)`; the safe version simply never leaves the PC. **Reachable today:** any operator who enters a malicious `<script>`/`<img onerror>` payload into a stock-audit note field, then anyone who opens the phone bridge's History tab while connected, executes it in their mobile session. Fix needs both sides: (a) send the already-sanitized string instead of the raw `h` at inventory-module.js:2778, and (b) get a sanitizer into `tools/remote-scanner.html` (currently has none) before assigning to `innerHTML` at line 1123, as defense-in-depth — don't rely on the sender alone. **Bonus tooling gap, worth fixing in the same task:** `scripts/xss-audit.js`'s `collectFiles()` only scans `index.html` + `assets/js/*.js` — it never scans `tools/*.html` at all, so this whole file family (including `tools/remote-capture.html`) has been invisible to every prior XSS audit; extend the scanner's file glob as part of this task so this class of bug can't hide again. Two lower-priority, currently-dormant sibling findings in the same file also surfaced during the same scout pass (not wired live today, don't fix unless convenient while already in this file): `populateItemsFromCache()` (remote-scanner.html:1064, unguarded, gated behind a `catalogCache` field the PC never sends) and `PC_STOCK_UPDATE`'s `gridHtml`/`alertBadgeHtml` handlers (remote-scanner.html:1081/1105, unguarded but currently fed only static/numeric content). *Done — fixed on both sides: send-side (`inventory-module.js`) now sanitizes once and reuses the result for both the local render and the broadcast payload, so they can never drift apart again; receive-side (`tools/remote-scanner.html`, which had zero sanitizer infra) got a new DOMPurify CDN tag (byte-identical to `index.html`'s existing tag/SRI hash) plus a local `window.safeHTML` shim, and sanitizes on receipt too as defense-in-depth — Realtime broadcast channels aren't RLS-scoped, so trusting the sender alone isn't sufficient. Also closed the 2 dormant siblings plus a 3rd, previously-undocumented sink found during planning (`tools/remote-capture.html:722`, a thumbnail-card builder) — all 3 rebuilt via native DOM construction rather than just wrapped, fully eliminating those sinks. Extended `scripts/xss-audit.js` to scan `tools/*.html` for the first time (previously invisible to every prior audit — exactly how this bug hid); a pre-existing, non-exploitable 15-finding inline-handler backlog in those files is demoted to advisory-only via a new `ADVISORY_ONLY_PREFIXES` tier so it doesn't retroactively break the blocking gate, while `index.html`/`assets/js/*.js`'s existing zero-violations blocking guarantee stays fully intact (confirmed: blocking-mode run exits 0). Live exploit reproduced on `main` first (real `<img onerror>` payload firing on the phone's screen) and confirmed blocked post-fix, per the manual testing guide. Post-implementation XSS validator's full-sink sweep surfaced one more pre-existing, unrelated Critical finding (`printReorderReport`'s unguarded `document.write`) — logged separately below as `fix/print-reorder-report-document-write-xss`, not fixed in this task's diff. Verified: 0 CRITICAL XSS violations (1 CRITICAL + the unscanned CVE itself before this fix → 0 after), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/fix-remote-scanner-history-xss-1.md](../docs/plans/fix-remote-scanner-history-xss-1.md)) [Files: assets/js/inventory-module.js, tools/remote-scanner.html, tools/remote-capture.html, scripts/xss-audit.js]
- [🚀] `fix/print-reorder-report-document-write-xss` : **Unsanitized document.write — Supply Chain Deficits Print Report** - Critical stored-XSS discovered 2026-07-20 by the `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss` post-implementation XSS validator during its full-sink sweep (re-confirming a finding first spotted, but never given its own ledger line, during `fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs`'s pre-task security scout). `assets/js/inventory-module.js:1059`, inside `window.printReorderReport` (the unrelated "Supply Chain Deficits" print report — starts ~line 887), does `win.document.write(html)` where `html` is assembled via unescaped `${...}` interpolation of `catalogCache`/`productsDB`-sourced item names and specs (e.g. `${d.n}`, `${c.itemName}`, `${x.sp}`) with **zero `DOMPurify.sanitize()` call anywhere in the path** — matches CLAUDE.md's explicitly banned `document.write` pattern verbatim. Present on `main` today, unrelated to and untouched by either of the two `fix/*-xss` branches that discovered it. **Also invisible to `scripts/xss-audit.js`** for the same bare-variable blind-spot reason documented in `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss`'s plan (`hasDynamic()` only recognizes same-line `${...}` template interpolation, and this call site's `html` variable is built up over many prior lines, not inline at the `document.write(html)` call itself) — a second, independent confirmation of that scanner limitation. Fix: `DOMPurify.sanitize(html)` on the assembled string before `win.document.write(...)`, matching the pattern already used correctly elsewhere in the app's print-window code paths (per the archived `debt/security` epic's "Moderate — Unguarded Print Window document.write" precedent). *Done — one-line fix (`const safe = DOMPurify.sanitize(html); win.document.write(safe);`), directly mirroring 3 already-correct sibling call sites in `production-module.js`/`packerz-module.js`/`print-module.js`. **Confirmed regression, not virgin code:** the archived `debt/security` epic (2026-07-01) named this exact function by line range as one of 5 sibling fixes and tagged it `[🚀]`/released — live-code cross-check of all 5 today shows 4 are still genuinely correct, only this one lost its `DOMPurify.sanitize()` call at some point after being marked done. **Process lesson:** an archived `[🚀]` completion tag does not guarantee the fix is still present in the file weeks/months later — worth a live re-grep spot-check of archived security fixes during periodic `/health_check` runs, not just trusting the tag at merge time. **Bundled a second instance discovered during planning (user-approved mid-review):** `assets/js/kpi-reports-module.js`'s `window.printKPIReport` had the identical unguarded pattern in a completely different file/button, never previously documented anywhere — fixed with the same pattern. That second sink is currently mitigated by an upstream `window.safeHTML` gate in `openKPIReport` before content ever reaches it (confirmed during manual verification: the natural DB-field exploit route is a false negative for this specific sink), so this fix is defense-in-depth against any future code path that populates `#kpiReportContent` without going through that gate, not a currently-reachable exploit via normal use — still correctly fixed regardless, per the same "trust the sender alone is not sufficient" reasoning used in the sibling `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss` task. Verified: 0 new XSS violations (scanner structurally blind to this bug class in both files — confirmed via manual exploit reproduction, not scanner exit code alone), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/fix-print-reorder-report-document-write-xss-1.md](../docs/plans/fix-print-reorder-report-document-write-xss-1.md)) [Files: assets/js/inventory-module.js, assets/js/kpi-reports-module.js]

#### 🟠 P1 — Active Epics
- [🚀] `fix/cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs` : **cc* Mobile Bridge — Silent Sync & Status Bugs** - 5 real, live bugs in the shipped phone-QR-scan bridge feature (STOCKPILEZ → STOCKZ → open any item's audit → `stockzAuditModal` → 📷 SCAN PORTAL → 📱 Smartphone Link), discovered during `debt/nomenclature-remediation` Batch 9's nomenclature trace and deliberately not fixed there (out of that batch's scope, matching the `fix/regex-playground-preset-bugs` precedent of logging live bugs found mid-sweep as their own task). **Finding 1 (MEDIUM):** the scanner connection-status dot (`stockzAuditScannerStatusIndicator`, index.html:6598) never turns green after a real phone connects — the only code that ever attempted this targets ghost id `ccScannerStatusIndicator` (inventory-module.js MOBILE_CONNECT handler), which has zero producer. **Finding 2 (LOW-MEDIUM):** the QR code doesn't auto-hide and the live preview doesn't auto-show the instant the phone connects — same ghost-id pattern (`ccScannerQRContainer`/`ccRemotePreviewScreenContainer`); the real modern siblings (`stockzAuditMobileQRContainer`/`stockzAuditMobilePreviewContainer`) are only ever toggled by the `MOBILE_PREVIEW_MODE_CHANGED` handler, which fires solely on a manual phone-side route-button tap, never automatically on connect. **Finding 3 (HIGH):** the phone's manual "Choose Item Natively" dropdown is always empty — the PC's `ITEM_DIRECTORY` broadcast reads ghost id `ccMngrItemSelect` so it always sends an empty list, AND the phone's own cache-based fallback (`populateItemsFromCache()`) is separately broken because the PC's `SESSION_TRANSFER` payload never includes the `catalogCache` field it's gated on. **Finding 4 (HIGH, silent data-loss risk):** phone-side manual item selection never syncs to the PC (`MOBILE_ITEM_SELECTED` handler reads the same ghost `ccMngrItemSelect` id) — if the operator picks a different item on the phone than what's active on the PC and submits a count, `MOBILE_SAVE_COUNT`'s `payload.value === window.currentAuditItemKey` save-guard silently fails with zero toast/error on either device; the count is just lost. **Finding 5 (MEDIUM, product decision needed, do not resolve unilaterally):** the PC-side 3-way preview-routing selector (`pcRoutePhone`/`pcRoutePC`/`pcRouteBoth`/`pcRouteBar`) and its handler `updateCCRouteUI()` are a confirmed 100%-dead function body (guard always trips, zero surviving markup) called from 2 live sites — ambiguous whether intentionally retired (superseded by the simpler 2-way `stockzAuditCameraRoute_pc`/`_phone` toggle that exists today) or a lost-but-still-desired feature per the original `docs/plans/feat-cycle-count-dual-preview.md` design doc; needs explicit product sign-off before deleting or restoring. Full evidence, exact reproduction steps, and minimal-fix pointers for all 5 in `docs/plans/debt-nomenclature-remediation-9.md` §4. ⚠️ Elevated to P1 (above P3/backlog) per explicit user direction on 2026-07-20 — Findings 3/4 represent a silent data-loss path in an actively-used inventory-counting workflow. *Done — fixed Findings 1-4 as one-line `getElementById` target corrections plus one call-site routing fix (`MOBILE_ITEM_SELECTED` now calls `window.selectStockzAuditItem(payload.value)` instead of a bare `.value=` assignment, correctly updating `window.currentAuditItemKey` and closing the silent save-loss bug). Finding 5: user chose "delete wholesale" over "restore" — removed `updateCCRouteUI()` and its 2 call sites entirely, keeping `let currentPreviewMode` since Finding 2's fix and the still-live `MOBILE_PREVIEW_MODE_CHANGED` handler both independently need it. Pre-task security scout surfaced a separate Critical stored-XSS (unrelated to these 5 findings) in the same bridge feature — logged as `fix/remote-scanner-history-xss` above per user decision, not fixed in this task's diff. Bonus nomenclature side effect: N1_GHOST_ID 13→2 codebase-wide (Finding 5's wholesale deletion swept up 6 more ghost reads beyond the 5 directly targeted; not this task's objective, reported for the sibling `debt/nomenclature-remediation` epic's bookkeeping). Verified: 0 XSS violations (before=0/after=0), 59/59 tests, 0 lint errors/warnings.* (Plan: [docs/plans/fix-cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs-1.md](../docs/plans/fix-cc-mobile-bridge-sync-bugs-1.md)) [Files: assets/js/inventory-module.js]
